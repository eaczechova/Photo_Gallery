# Photo_Gallery

1. It's an interactive photo gallery created using JavaScript and jQuery as a part of Team Treehouse Techdegree course.

2. Here you can find [link](https://eaczechova.github.io/Photo_Gallery/) to the project website. 

3. The aim of the project is to create a responsive image gallery.
  - When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox.
  - I have used jQuery plugin [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/).
  - User can search photos by caption content and photos will hide or show depending on user input.

4. Thumbnails and photos were provided with descriptions.
